#Mask Detection

The code provides a custom CNN model and also Resnet50 model to detect mask and non-mask faces. The models are trained from the images present in this https://github.com/prajnasb/observations/tree/master/experiements/data github link.

An Vaidation accuracy of 94% is achieved from the custom model and by just using the weights of resnet50 model accuracy of 71% was achieved. Resnet50 model needs further finetuning which will be updated in the code very soon.
